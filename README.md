    <h1>AirBnB Clone</h1>
    <p>In this project, ALX participants have the opportunity to become hosts on the Airbnb platform, allowing them to open their homes to travelers from around the world. Through this hands-on experience, participants gain valuable skills in hospitality, communication, and cultural exchange. They learn how to create welcoming and memorable guest experiences while also generating income.</p>

	<ol>
	<li>A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)</li>
	<li>A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic</li>
	<li>A database or files that store data (data = objects)</li>
	<li>An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)</li>
